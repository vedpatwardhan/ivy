Design
======

| Ivy can fulfill two distinct purposes:
|
| 1. enable automatic code conversions between frameworks
| 2. serve as a new ML framework with multi-framework support
|
| The Ivy codebase can then be split into three categories, and can be further split into 8 distinct submodules, each of which fall into one of these three categories as follows:
|

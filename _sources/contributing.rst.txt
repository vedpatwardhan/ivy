Ivy API
-------

All function signatures for the Ivy API are defined in the :code:`ivy.functional.ivy` submodule. Functions written here
should adhere to the following format:


.. code-block:: python


    def my_func(x: ivy.Array,
                dtype: Optional[Union[ivy.Dtype, str]] = None,
                dev: Optional[Union[ivy.Dev, str]] = None):
        """
        My function does something cool.

        :param x: input array.
        :param dtype: array data type.
        :param dev: the device on which to place the new array.
        :return: a cooler array.
        """
        return _cur_framework(x).my_func(x, dtype, dev)

All functions which adhere to the `Array API`_ standard should be placed in the submodule :code:`ivy.functional.ivy.array_api`,
and should also be placed in the correct file in alignment with the categories used in the standard.


Backend API
-----------

Code in the backend submodules such as :code:`ivy.functional.backends.torch` should then look something like:

.. code-block:: python


    def my_func(x: torch.Tensor,
                dtype: Optional[Union[torch.dtype, str]] = None,
                dev: Optional[Union[torch.device, str]] = None):
        dtype = ivy.dtype_from_str(ivy.default_dtype(dtype, x))
        dev = ivy.dev_from_str(ivy.default_dev(dev, x))
        return torch.something_cool(x, dtype, dev)

Specifically, we should use type hints for all arguments in the Ivy API and also the backend APIs. These type hints
should be identical apart from all :code:`ivy.Array`, :code:`ivy.Dtype` and :code:`ivy.Dev` types replaced by
framework-specific types.

The backend methods should not add a docstring, as this would be identical to the docstring provided in the Ivy API.

All backend functions which adhere to the `Array API`_ standard should also be placed in submodules such as
:code:`ivy.functional.backends.torch.array_api`, and should also be placed in the correct file in alignment with the
categories used in the standard.


Array Operators
---------------

Array operators are defined in the :code:`ivy.array` submodule. Operators written here should adhere to the following format:

.. code-block:: python


    @_native_wrapper
    def __pow__(self, power):
        power = to_native(power)
        res = ivy.builtin_pow(self._data, power)
        if res is NotImplemented:
            return res
        return to_ivy(res)

There is no need to write docstrings for these methods, as they should always defer to a method such as
:code:`ivy.builtin_some_op`, which will itself have a docstring. The remaining code is essentially simple wrapper code
around this builtin ivy method.

The associated ivy backend methods should be placed in the same file as the operators. For example, :code:`__pow__` is
an arithmetic operator, and so this operator should be placed in the submodule :code:`ivy.array.array_api.arithmetic_operators`.
The method :code:`ivy.builtin_pow` should also be placed in :code:`ivy.array.array_api.arithmetic_operators`.

For most methods and backends these are very simple to implement, such as :code:`ivy.builtin_pow` below:

.. code-block:: python

    # noinspection PyShadowingBuiltins
    def builtin_pow(self: Union[ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray],
                    other: Union[int, float, ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray]) \
            -> Union[ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray]:
        """
        Calculates an implementation-dependent approximation of exponentiation by raising each element (the base) of an
        array instance to the power of other_i (the exponent), where other_i is the corresponding element of the array other.

        :param self: array instance whose elements correspond to the exponentiation base. Should have a numeric data type.
        :param other: other array whose elements correspond to the exponentiation exponent. Must be compatible with x
                        (see Broadcasting). Should have a numeric data type.
        :return: an array containing the element-wise results. The returned array must have a data type determined by
                  Type Promotion Rules.
        """
        return self.__pow__(other)

However, for some backends this does not work. For example, MXNet does not support reshaping arrays to 0-dim arrays,
but this is required by the standard. Therefore, we've written custom methods for handling 0-dim arrays. For backends
such as this where more customization is needed, then we must simply redefine these methods, such as :code:`ivy.builtin_pow`,
in the associated backend submodule, in this case :code:`ivy.functional.backends.mxnet.array_builtins.array_api.arithmetic_operators`.

The custom MXNet code is as follows, with the addition of an MXNet-specific function decorator to properly handle flat arrays:

.. code-block:: python

    @_handle_flat_arrays_in_out
    def builtin_pow(self, other):
        return self.__pow__(other)

Again, a docstring is not needed given that this is the same as the one provided in :code:`ivy.array.array_api.arithmetic_operators`.
For other backends, we do not need to specify a custom :code:`builtin_pow` method. These will default to the version implemented in
:code:`ivy.array.array_api.arithmetic_operators` if no custom implementation is provided.
